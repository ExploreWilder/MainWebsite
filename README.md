## Demo

The project is my website: https://explorewilder.com/

It is currently hosted in a shared server running a virtual environment of Python 3.

## About

This is just an example of website using awesome open source technologies! The project was not created to be a template or a flexible CMS, but for my own use. Feel free to take whatever inspiration from it that you want. Here is a list of implemented features:

- [x] Hi-res photo viewer
- [x] Configurable multi-layer map viewers (2D and 3D) with interactive elevation profile
- [x] Show stories (markdown file and scrollytelling 2.5D map)
- [x] Likes without subscription â€“ easy peasy lemon squeezy!
- [x] Social networks share buttons
- [x] Twitter and Mastodon timelines displayed without external requests
- [x] Contact and feedback forms
- [x] Exclusive access: restricted area and unlocked features
- [x] Emails (newsletter + account management)
- [x] Privacy friendly and GDPR compliant
- [x] Security focused
- [x] Web responsive and cross browser compatible
- [x] SEO optimisations
- [x] Ko-fi.com webhook integration
- [x] Admin space: manage the gallery, stories, members, see statistics (likes and views)
