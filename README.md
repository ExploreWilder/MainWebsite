## Demo

The project is my website: https://explorewilder.com/

It is currently hosted in a shared server running a virtual environment of Python 3.

- [x] Show stories (markdown file and scrollytelling 2.5D map)
- [x] Likes without subscription â€“ easy peasy lemon squeezy!
- [x] Social networks share buttons
- [x] Twitter and Mastodon timelines displayed without external requests
- [x] Contact and feedback forms
- [x] Exclusive access: restricted area and unlocked features
- [x] Emails (newsletter + account management)
- [x] Privacy friendly and GDPR compliant
- [x] Security focused
- [x] Web responsive and cross browser compatible
- [x] SEO optimisations
