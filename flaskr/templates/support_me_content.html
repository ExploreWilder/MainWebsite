<p>Do you like my pictures? Do you enjoy my adventures?<br />
If you do, your support is highly appreciated, and rewarded!<br />
If you don't, please tell me why thanks to the <a href="/about">contact form</a>.</p>
<p>I share everything for free, for you, for the world! This website is ad-free and privacy super friendly. Your donation would help me to pay the hosting fee and the domain name. But it isn't just about money, it's really motivating! Without your support, I would think that sharing hundreds of pictures and years of adventures doesn't worth a coffee. With your support, I will keep sharing more and better content!</p>
