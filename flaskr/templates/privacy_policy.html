**About Cookies:** Not a single *third party* cookie is used but this website uses cookies to store *pseudonymous* data (session cookies and security tokens) and a tracker (aka cookie ID). The extended cookie lifetime is only permitted by your consent.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
    <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> To sum up: <strong>0 third party cookie, 1 tracker disabled by default.</strong>

**App Token:** A software using your ExploreWilder Token has only access to your username. Your *personal data* are not forwarded to *third parties*. The software and this website also share a random unique identifier that does not contain any system or personal information.

    <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> To sum up: <strong>the app token is not a tracker but a virtual membership card.</strong>
</div>

---------------------------------------

**What The Information Are Used For?** The cookie ID is used to distinguish visitors to build up stats. The IP address is used for security and traffic analysis purposes. Your user agent are used for debug, stats, and security purposes. Any data *processing* is anonymised. It is possible, however, to uniquely identify a visitor activity with some efforts of data analysis and software engineering.

---------------------------------------

**Data Retention & Your Rights:** The web hosting service keeps logs (IP addresses and user agents) for no longer than a month. Otherwise, most of the collected data maybe stored for an extended period of time. Nevertheless, you have the fundamental *right to access*, rectification and erasure of your *personal data*. I'll respond to every request for information and the *right of erasure*. If you've subscribed to the newsletter and don't want to receive news anymore, you can unsubscribe thanks to the link at the bottom of the email. Then, your name and email will be automatically deleted. If you were a member, your account would be deleted!

---------------------------------------

**Privacy & Security:** Any *personal data breach* or unlawful use of your personal data is considered critical. If detected, my [status page](https://explorewilder.statuspage.io/) would be updated consequently. Your privacy is important to me. That is why 100% of the collected data as well as my website (content and interface) are stored in the GDPR-compliant [A2Hosting](https://www.a2hosting.com/about/policies) data centers located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Backups are stored encrypted in GDPR-compliant and ISO 27001 certified data centers. Your collected data are not processed by any *third party*. A strict [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy "Content Security Policy") is used ([rated A](https://securityheaders.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fexplorewilder.com) by securityheaders.com). Members' passwords are stored in hashed form. All requests and data to/from my website are encrypted before being transmitted over the Internet with the TLS protocol ([rated A+](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=explorewilder.com&hideResults=on) by the Qualys' SSL Labs, with HSTS and PFS among other security features). Emails are transmitted over SMTP (with SPF, DKIM, DMARC among other security features) and do not contain any tracking solutions (no images, no tracking pixels, no tracking links). I have no access to your financial information, those are handled by the donation platform (Patreon) or a third party (PayPal for Kofi).
